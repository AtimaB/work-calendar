# Work Day Planner
For this assignment I get to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

## How dose this planner work?
When the user open the planner, the current day will be displayed at the top of the planner and will be the timeblock for bussiness hours (9am-5pm). Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user will be able to add things they need to do and click save to the planner.
